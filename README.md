# shellmind ðŸ§

actual shell commands. It is not just an llm client, but integrates into the
shell for convenience and speed.

2. Add a [keybind](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/bind.html) to `.config/fish/functions/fish_user_key_bindings.fish`:
    ```fish
    function fish_user_key_bindings
        # ...
        # Your other keybinds
        # ...

        # For Ctrl-X:
        bind \cx 'shellmind'

        # For Ctrl-X in insert mode when using Vi mode:
        bind -M insert \cx 'shellmind'
    end
    ```

### Bash

   You may edit that file for some optional configuration options.

   ```bash
   source /path/to/shellmind.bash

2. Add a keybind to your `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   # For Ctrl-G
   bind -x '"\C-g": shellmind'
   ```

### Zsh

    source /path/to/shellmind.zsh
    ```

3. Add a [keybind](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Key-Bindings) to your `.zshrc`:

    # For Ctrl-G:
    zle -N shellmind
    bindkey '^G' shellmind
    ```
